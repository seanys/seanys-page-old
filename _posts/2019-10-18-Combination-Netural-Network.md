| Bin Packing with DRL | **Input**: a sequence of size data (length, width and height) of items to be packed**Output**: another sequence which represents the order we pack those items **Evaluation**: We use the surface area (SA) of the bin to evaluate the sequence, and we use SA(o\|s) to denote the surface area | This algorithm use aim dataset to train the network, so it needs a  lot time to train the RNN and doesn't fit new shapes combination |
