## Initial Solution

### Bottom left fill

To generate the initial feasible layout, the bottom-left heuristic by Gomes and Oliveira (2002) is used.

Local search in packing problem always works by change the position of a strip regardless of the overlap. Then we should choose the position which can achieve the lowest overlap area, 

### Fast local search



### Cuckoo search



### Tabu search



### Simulating Annealing



### Extended Local Search
