Local search in packing problem always works by change the position of a strip regardless of the overlap. Then we should choose the position which can achieve the lowest overlap area,

### 3.3 Genetic Algorithm

Source: Algorithm for 2D irregular-shaped nesting problem based on the NFP algorithm and lowest-gravity-center principle

To achieve high quality nesting sequence, GA is adopted in this paper. Some of its important features are listed below.

#### Gene encoding of the solution

Because the proposed lowest-gravity-center placement principle can determine the gravity center and rotation angle of a piece (Fig.4), there is no need to encode rotation angle into the chromosome, **the only thing we need to encode is the nesting sequence (permutation order).**

#### Initialization

The first generation of individuals has great influence on the final GA result. To get a set of well-defined initial individuals, **sorted-by-area nesting permutation is used as the first individual**, and then other individuals are created by mutations of the first individual with all these individuals forming the first generation.

#### Fitness function and fitness scaling

The height of the remaining containing region is taken as the fitness, a fitness linear scaling function is adopted to scale the fitness value to a reasonable range:

$$f ′=αf+β+σ$$

here $f$ is the original fitness and $f ′$ is the output scaled fitness with

$$α=\frac{f_{avg}}{f_{avg} − f_{min}}, β=\frac{-f_{min}f_{avg}}{f_{avg} − f_{min}}, σ=\frac {f_{avg}} K$$

Because proportional selection method is adopted in this GA, some individuals with very low fitness will be rejected too early, which may lead to premature convergence, so σ is added to the fitness function to avoid this kind of rejection.

#### Crossover

OX (order-crossover (Davis, 1985)) crossover is adopted in this paper. Suppose one parent is (5, 2, 3, 7, 6, 1, 4) and another parent is (4, 6, 2, 1, 3, 5, 7), the OX crossover procedure is illustrated in Fig.7.

#### Mutation

Mutation occurs after crossover and is applied to newly generated child-individuals. Here mutation is used to exchange two numbers in the chromosome, the mutation probability is 0.1~0.2. Sometimes two segments of the chromosome can also be exchanged, in such case the mutation probability should be de- creased since the chromosome is greatly changed.
