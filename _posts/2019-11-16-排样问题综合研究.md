## Introduction

**The nesting problem is a very common problem and its economic and ecological impact is obvious in many industrial environments such as glass, paper, leather, textile, and sheet metal industries. **

**This problem is a class of the cutting and packing problems and it is a combinatorial optimization problem that deals with various types of polygons including irregular or non-convex polygons, convex polygons, as well as rectangles.** 

The problem involves placing a set of input polygons on a rectangular sheet or container of a fixed width (W) and variable length (L) ensuring that there are no overlapping polygons or protruding from the con- tainer. Using the typology of Wäscher, Haußner, and Schumann (2007), this problem is categorized as the two-dimensional irregular open dimensional problem (ODP). 

**The main objective is to maximize the container utilization or to minimize its length while accommodating all polygons inside. The high utilization is greatly desirable in industry so as to minimize the waste material since the material cost is often the major part of the production cost. **

The nesting problem has a few variations relying on rotations of polygons: (1) rotations of any angle are allowed, (2) a finite number of angles are allowed, and (3) no rotation is allowed. In some industries such as textile or clothing industry, there is a restriction on the shape rotation due to the fabric drawing patterns and intrin- sic characteristics, so it is limited to 0° or 180°. **The nesting problem is known to be NP-hard even without rotation** (Nielsen & Odgaard, 2003).

In the industrial environments this problem is usually tackled by experienced workers who build the nesting layout and this may be with the aid of CAD systems. The quality and utilization produced by those skilled workers is high when it is compared with that produced from the available commercial software packages. A list of semi-automatic commercial solutions is available in Hopper (2000) and Nielsen and Odgaard (2003). 



## Basic geometry concept

### No fit polygon(NFP)

NFP is introduce in another article.

### Inner fit polygon (IFP)

New added piece need be put inside the constrain rectangle, so we should compute the feasible area for this piece. We can use the same way choose a reference point and slide the new piece around rectangle inner. Then, the NFP's intersection boundary which inside the inner rectangle is the valid positions.

## How to find most suitabel position

### Dominate Point

Dominate point is proposed in [A new approach for sheet nesting problem using guided cuckoo search and pairwise clustering](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221713005080). It is mainly used in convex and concave combination.

In this method, we need compute the no fit polygon first. Then, we should get the convex envelop and compute the distance from all endpints of NFP to convex envelope's edges. In many situation, DP will grasp the highest utilization ratio.



### Extend polygon fit degree

There is no dominate point in convex shape and convex shape's combination. In many case, even if it's convex shape and concave shape's combination, dominate point will not achieve the best utilization ratio.

Fit degree is put forward for this situation. We need compute the extend polygons first and the intersection's area of extend polygons shows the fit degree.

The position where can hold the highest fit degree will always achieve the highest utilization ratio.
